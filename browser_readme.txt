directory browser:

the browser is still pretty rough around the edges, but generally works.

on the left is an image that represents the directory you are in.  below the image is a text area with the path to the directory in it.  clicking on this text area will move you up one level in the directory structure.  below that are two buttons, one for appending all the sub-directories and music files in the current directory to the playlist, the other for prepending.

if there are any music files in the current directory, they will be displayed on the right after the subdirectories, and two more buttons will appear on the left for appending or prepending selected files (multiple selection is supported.)

double clicking a file on the right side will insert it in the playlist after the currently playing track, and play it.

double clicking a directory on the right side will enter that directory.

that's about it.  still working out lots of details/bugs...
