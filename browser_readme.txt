directory browser:

the browser is still pretty rough around the edges, but generally works.

on the left is an image that represents the directory you are in.  clicking on this image will select all subdirectories and files within the current directory.

below the image is a text area with the path to the current directory in it.  clicking on this text area will move you up one level in the directory structure.  

on the right all subdirectories and music files in the current directory are shown.  selecting a directory or file will activate the 'add to list' buttons - "list <<" appends all selected files and subdirectories to the list, ">> list" prepends them.

double clicking a file on the right side will insert it in the playlist after the currently playing track, and play it.

double clicking a directory on the right side will enter that directory.
